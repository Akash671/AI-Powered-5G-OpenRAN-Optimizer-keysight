# AI-Powered-5G-OpenRAN-Optimizer
Welcome to AI-Powered Open RAN Optimization!

This repository provides a comprehensive AI-powered optimization system for Open RAN, which leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to optimize the performance of the network. With this system, you can detect network anomalies in real-time, predict network traffic, and dynamically optimize network resources allocation based on real-time network conditions. Moreover, you can also optimize the energy consumption of the network by dynamically adjusting network resources allocation based on the energy efficiency of different network components.

The system is designed to learn from historical data, real-time network data, and external data sources to continuously improve its performance. To achieve this, we provide a modular structure consisting of various AI technologies, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. You can use this structure to develop and train the machine learning models that power the optimization system. Additionally, we support the integration of open-source AI frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, to enable easy development and training of the models.

This repository follows a clean and organized directory structure to facilitate easy navigation and usage. In the `data` directory, you can find historical and real-time network data, as well as external data sources that can be used to improve the accuracy of the models. In the `models` directory, you can find various AI models that can be used for network anomaly detection, predictive network planning, dynamic network optimization, and energy efficiency optimization. The `src` directory contains the source code for each of the AI models, data preparation, evaluation, and utility functions. Additionally, the `tests` directory provides unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of the system. The `docs` directory contains the user guide, developer guide, and API reference documentation, while the `examples` directory provides various examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts to showcase the capabilities of the system.

To get started, you can install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, you can use the `setup.py` file to install the package and its dependencies. Once installed, you can start exploring the system by following the examples provided in the `examples` directory or by using the AI models provided in the `models` directory.

We hope this repository will help you build an efficient and effective AI-powered optimization system for Open RAN. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
