# AI-Powered-5G-OpenRAN-Optimizer
Welcome to the AI-Powered 5G Open RAN Optimizer repository! This project aims to implement an advanced and complex AI-powered optimization system for Open RAN networks that leverages machine learning algorithms to optimize the network's performance.

The system is designed to learn from historical data, real-time network data, and external data sources to identify network anomalies, predict network traffic, and optimize network resource allocation. The AI-powered optimization system includes features such as network anomaly detection, predictive network planning, dynamic network optimization, and energy efficiency optimization.

The system uses open-source AI frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras to develop and train the machine learning models. It also integrates with Open RAN interfaces, such as O-RAN, to enable seamless integration and interoperability.
